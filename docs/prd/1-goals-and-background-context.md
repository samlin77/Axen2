# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable enterprise users to securely interact with AI agents (Gemini, ChatGPT) while accessing corporate data through MCP
- Provide enterprise-grade security, governance, and compliance controls for AI deployments
- Deliver desktop-first platform with offline capability and <30 day deployment time
- Support multi-LLM strategy with unified governance and cost optimization
- Achieve 500 enterprise customers and $15M ARR in Year 1

## Background Context

Enterprise AI tools lack the security, governance, and integration capabilities needed for production deployment. While 89% of enterprises cite security as their top AI adoption concern, 72% plan to increase AI investment in 2025.

This product addresses the market gap by providing the first enterprise-grade AI agent platform with native MCP security layer (MCP-Defender), multi-LLM support, and comprehensive compliance controls - at 40-50% lower cost than alternatives like Microsoft Copilot.
